Question:
Write a program that takes an integer array (A) and an index i into A,  rearrange the elements such that all elements less than A[i] appear first,  at the beginning, followed by elements equal to A[i], then elements greater than A[i].

For example:
A =[5, 6, 2, 7, 8, 3, 6, 2, 4, 5], A[i]= 5, output [2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 6] is a valid output
A =[5, 6, 2, 7, 8, 3, 6, 2, 4, 5], A[i]= 7, output [2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8] is a valid output
